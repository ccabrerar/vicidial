QC(Quality Control) process flow					  2012-11-16

Thanks to the Pound Team(pounteam.com) and Affinity On-Call(affinity.co.za) for 
contributing this functionaly QC application to the vicidial project.

Below are the basic operating instructions for how the QC system works.

As of SVN/trunk revision 1877, this is built into the vicidial codebase.

The full instructions for how to use these QC features will be added to the Vicidial
Manager Manuals soon.

For the full QC manual, go here:
http://www.vicidial.org/docs/Vicidial_Quality_Control_Manual_v1.pdf



To enable QC functionality, go to Admin -> System Settings and set "QC Features Active" to "1", then submit.
(Note: API must also be active in the System Settings for this to work)


Configure Campaigns/Lists/Users:

For Each Campaign:
Detail View (top menu)
QC (top menu)
QC Enabled: Y
Check boxes for one or more Statuses

For Each List:
Audit Comments: Y (Optional, only if using Audited Comments)

For Each QC User: (such as 6666 or admin, plus any other QC users)
QC Enabled: 1
QC User Level: 1
QC Pass: 1
QC Finish: 1
QC Commit: 1
Agent Call Manual: 1
Agent API Access: 1

For Each AGENT: (non QC, standard agents)
Agent-Only Callbacks: 1
Agent Call Manual: 1


Notes:
Campaigns with QC active will now appear under the “Quality Control” left menu.
Calls dispositioned in one of those campaigns with a QC selected status will appear under the Campaign.
Clicking on each lead will allow the QC agent to “Pass/Fail/Cancel” each lead. Fail will appear in the “Callbacks” for the originating agent to “re-sell” or fix the problem(s) with the sale.
If activated, Audited Comments will be visible in QC Modify Lead (NOT in “Comments” for each lead, they are removed from this editable field and placed in a view only table!). Agents may view comment history when on a call with a client who has comment history. Administrators must be in QC Modify Lead to view comment history.






Each Campaign:

Enable QC for each campaign
Detail View -> QC -> QC Enabled = Y

Choose QC Statuses
Check the boxes for each Status you want to be managed by the QC system. You can select just one (such as SALE), or you can select as many as you would like. 
Any previously dispositioned leads with these statuses will automatically be included in the QC system, even though QC was not installed when they happened.


Each List:

Enable Audited Comments for each List
Audited Comments = Y
Audited comments will move comments made by agents to a secure table where agents will be able to VIEW but not CHANGE those previous comments. They will also be available for VIEW in the QC system for modifying leads. This can also be accessed by those in the Admin Modify Lead page for those with QC privileges (link at the bottom of the page to move to the QC modify page, which will log all views/edits).

Note: This is optional and only applies if you want to activate the audited comments system. This will only affect campaigns on which it is turned on. This cannot be “deactivated” to retrieve the comments. Once comments are “audited” they are moved to a separate table and no longer editable or visible on the record except in the audited comments system.
Choose QC Statuses
Check the boxes for each Status you want to be managed by the QC system. You can select just one (such as SALE), or you can select as many as you would like. 
Any previously dispositioned leads with these statuses will automatically be included in the QC system, even though QC was not installed when they happened.

Modify/Create System QC Results
Admin -> System Statuses -> QC Status Codes

Modify the names of the “CANCEL”, “PASS”, “FAIL” status codes to suit your needs (do not change the CATEGORY).

Note: We have not tested qc with different names. Please send feedback regarding success OR failure of changing the names!

Note: Creating new QC Results is (as yet) untested. (Alpha: use at your own risk, please report results)

Note: “Commit” category is not yet active (Can be created and possibly chosen, but will cause no “action” within Vicidial regarding QC).

Info Regarding QC Categories
 “Cancel” category items will simply change the status to the given statuscode.
“Pass” category items will simply change the status to the given statuscode.
“Fail” category items will create a callback for the sales agent which will require that the sale be re-sold to get back to QC again.

Note: Fail category items require a MATCHING System Status or Campaign Status with “Schedule Callback” = “Y” to cause a callback to be created. 

Note: Adding new “Fail” or other QC Results is (as yet) untested. . (Alpha: use at your own risk, please report results)


Standard and QC User requirements

Regular users must have agent-only callback and Agent Call Manual (or they cannot call clients back for a QC reject, so this is required for QC callbacks).
Vicidial Administration->Users->(choose user)->Agent-Only Callbacks

Agent Call Manual

QC Users must have Agent Call Manual (or they cannot call clients during QC)
Vicidial Administration->Users->(choose user)->Agent Call Manual 

Agent Call Manual

User Level of 2 or greater

QC Enabled

Agent API Access

QC User Level 1 (or higher, levels are not yet differentiated but will be as the package matures)

QC Pass / Finish / Commit – Not in use yet.
User Group settings for QC Allowed Campaigns / InGroups – Not in use yet.
Standard Agent Interface
QC Rejections will be received in “Callbacks”. 
Method to resolve a QC Rejection: Manual dial client, correct errors and/or create new recording based on notes from QC agent in the QCFAIL callback record.
Agent Call Manual – Without this the agent cannot manual dial

Agent-Only Callbacks – Without this the agent will not see callback notification in agent window

QC User Interface
Note: Until there are QC campaigns with Sales in them … there will be nothing to look at in the QC menu!
Enter the QC System
Admin->Quality Control

Choose a Campaign to QC

Select one record at a time to QC

QC Each Record in Queue
With Each Record:
Listen to recordings listed at bottom of screen
To call client you must be logged in, in manual dial mode, in the correct campaign (Alpha NOTE: System does not presently verify Campaign!)
IF you call the client, disposition that call normally FIRST (as any agent would). THEN disposition in the QC window. Do not make changes in the AGENT screen (this may change in later versions), except to disposition at the end of the call.
After completing the call on the agent screen and dispositioning, choose your QC Result in the QC screen. 
To set the call to FAIL (and require the original agent to re-call the client): 
QC Result: FAIL
SUBMIT
If you want to make specific notes regarding the reason for the failure, they can be made in one of two ways:
1. Use the Comment field before submitting (At present these notes will be editable / deletable by the agent).
2. After submitting press Go back to re-modify this QC lead and modify the CallBack Details. (These will be temporary and viewable only by the agent during the call. However, in the future these will then appear with the Audited Comments because they are stored in the Vicidial callbacks table.)
To specify a Date/Time other than “NOW” for the callback OR to schedule for a different user or to leave notes for the reason for the FAIL:
Press “Go back to re-modify this QC lead” on the resulting page 
Then set the date/time/user
SUBMIT (at the bottom of the callback details, not the QC Result!)
When done, click on QC Campaign at the top of the page for your next record
Quality Control Log
Viewing: 
The QC log records are only visible within the QC system. Each time a QC agent views or modifies a record, the view and all changes are logged. It can be viewed on each lead record along with the call and recording logs.
Log showing viewed*:

Log showing modified*:

*Note: There will always be a “viewed” record as the last entry when YOU are VIEWING the record. Obviously.
Viewing actual changes to the record:
The record is viewed via the “tooltip” accessed by putting your mouse over the word “details”. We will later add a “Detail viewing page”. This function works well in IE, but in Firefox there is no “Line Ending” option in a tooltip, so the lines are not easily read.

Note for developers: All information for the viewed and modified records is stored in vicidial_qc_agent_log. All changes made to the vicidial_list record are stored in the “details” field.
Notes
Testing: “QC Only” user modeled after “Reporting Only” user. Requires user level > 1, active = “Y”, and QC Enabled. 
To QC Modify a lead that is NOT presently a QC status (whether it was in the past or not), search for and Modify the lead (under Lists->Search for a Lead), then click on “Click here to QC Modify this lead” at the bottom of the Admin Modify Lead screen (if you have QC permissions, this will be visible).

** THIS QC FUNCTIONALITY PROSESS IS PLANNED FOR THE 2.0.5 RELEASE AND IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT **

This will outline the process I have thought through for adding a Quality Assurance(QA) or Quality Control(QC) process to the VICIDIAL system. As the needs have changed for sponsor client and VICIDIAL has evolved since this functionality was first put into the planning stages, there have been several changes to how the QC process is going to be built. The objective is to add the following QC features to make VICIDIAL a more well-rounded product:
- ability to define which statuses are to be able to be QCd per campaign and inbound group(queue)
- ability to give agents permission to QC records for their allowable campaigns/inbound groups
- ability to log all access and changes to QCd records
- creation of some basic reports on QC activity



The back-end process will work like this:
- ADMIN_keepalive_ALL.pl script will look for the 'Q' in the keepalive definition in /etc/astguiclient.conf file. If it is set, it will trigger a script (QC_gather_records.pl) to gather the QC records every five minutes(with a 15 second delay) since the last QC gathering as defined in the system_settings table qc_last_pull_time field(which is populated with four-hours-before the START time of the last QC-pull run to make sure to catch all potential long calls that may have ended). The time interval for this might be made configurable.
- There will also be an optional method of pulling QC records available to the QC managers that enables them to specify a date range to pull and insert records
- Selected records from the vicidial_list table (keyed on the the vicidial_log and vicidial_closer_log tables) will be taken and inserted into the vicidial_qc_list table.
- QC agents are then able to run their process starting with the earliest records for their selected campaign/inbound groups
- After QC agents have PASSed, FINISHed and COMMITted the QC records, then they can be exported



Agent-side scripts:
 - qc.php - the screen that agents log in to 
 - qc_query.php - the data processing script that handles most of the AJAX queries and IFRAME displays from qc.php


The QC agent will login to the new qc.php screen within the agc web directory. They will then have a screen very similar to the vicidial.php login screen(but in a different color) that will have a user/pass to fill in. Then when they login the QC agents with level of 1-3 will see a green screen similar to the vicidial.php inbound(CLOSER-type) screen that will show them their allowable qc inbound-groups and campaigns. The agent will then choose which in-groups and campaigns that they want to QC the records for and then they will submit and they will be logged-in to the QC system. QC agents with a qc_level of 4-5 can select to review first level reccords, review all 2nd level records, review only 2nd level changed-status or review 2nd level same-status records. QC agents with 6-7 qc_level can also have the option of entering a management screen showing more information on the QC system including committing QC records and links to QC reports.

Upon login, they will be able to see the count of QC-able records and they can click on a link to bring up the next record to be QCd. 

Upon clicking on a link, the qc.php application will insert a record into the vicidial_qc_log to keep track of changes and other information on the qc record session. The customer and original call data will remain unaltered in the vicidial_qc_list table.

The SCRIPTS tab and web form will both function exactly as they do in the vicidial.php application, with the exception that there will be added qc_web_form_address and qc_script options for both campaigns and inbound groups. There will also be an option to have any of these launched upon a new record appearing on the QC agent's screen.

The qc.php user interface will be using AJAX as a method to bring up records and keep track of QC-agent activity and performance.

An optional element is for a small audio frame be opened with each new customer record that will have an audio recording of the call that the QC agent can listen to. At this point in time, the best candidate for this is the Flourish Flash-based application(http://flourishplayer.sourceforge.net/) It is open source under a BSD-like license and is based on Adobe Flash, which currently seems to be much more lightweight and provides a much lower barrier to entry on most platforms than JAVA does.



Each qc_user_level will have different permissions for the qc system:
1- modify nothing
2- modify nothing but status
3- modify everything
4- can check records of other QC agents
5- can view stats on qc system and unlock locked records from first level QC agents
6- can view finished and non-committed records and alter them and unlock locked records from first and second level QC agents
7- Manager level (can do anything including delete QC records)

The the QC agent roles:
FIRST - first level review
SECOND_ALL - second level review all records
SECOND_CHANGED - second level review only changed-status records
SECOND_PASSED - second level review only unchanged-status records
THIRD - third level review and commit/clear
MANAGER - manager level actions

The qc_stage is a record status within QC that tells what is going on with the record:
NEW - record has never been QCd
LOCK_1 - a QC agent is reviewing the record
PASS - QC agent has passed the record
LOCK_2 - a QC agent is reviewing the record for possible finishing
FINISH - record is ready to be processed
COMMIT - QC record is committed to the system and cannot be modified by anyone
DEAD - QC record is old and present for logs only, newer record has taken it's place
