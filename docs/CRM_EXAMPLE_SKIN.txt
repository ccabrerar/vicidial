CRM EXAMPLE SKIN DOCUMENT	Started: 2015-12-27	Updated: 2017-06-01

This document describes one method of integrating with the agent screen using 
a basic skin. This method could be used as a guide to integrate a CRM web system
with Vicidial, or it could be used to create your own simple custom agent screen
for Vicidial while keeping the full agent screen hidden. This example is not 
designed as a robust solution, it is merely an example of how one can work.



Files included:

(located in the "extras/crm_iframe" directory)
- front.php - the initial page the agent goes to, loads IFRAMEs for the Vicidial agent screen and the CRM(or basic agent screen)
- crm_example.php - a basic agent screen, interacts with the Vicidial Agent API to control the agent screen
- crm_settings.php - settings for the basic screen you need to customize for your system



Summary:

We have several clients that already use Vicidial with their own custom CRM systems. They will load the agent screen in a hidden IFRAME within their own agent screen, and control it entirely with API calls from their CRM to the Vicidial Agent API(see docs/AGENT_API.txt). This method allows for the agent to only use the custom CRM interface as they operate normally handling calls.

This example includes a very basic agent screen skin that will allow an agent to:
- Log in to vicidial
- Go active(or READY) so they can take incoming or auto-dialed calls
- Have basic customer information show up on their screen and allow editing of this information
- Hang up the customer phone call and set a disposition for the phone call
- Log out of the agent screen



Settings:

In the "crm_settings.php" file, you will see several variables that you will need to populate for this example to operate:
- The full URL to the Agent Screen (usually something like "http://server/agc/vicidial.php")
- The full URL to the Agent API (usually something like "http://server/agc/api.php")
- The user and pass of a level 8 user that has API and modify lead permissions
- The name of the CRM IFRAME that will be used for the CRM portion(default is 'crmagent')



Installation:

- Copy the "extras/crm_iframe" directory to your active web directory(we would suggest changing the name though)
- Create a new User with a "User Level" of 8, "Agent API Access" enabled, and "Modify Leads" enabled
- Update the settings to your system settings as outlined above
- Change your Campaign settings for:
	- "Web Form" - full URL to point to the "crm_example.php" page (usually something like "http://server/crm_iframe/crm_example.php")
	- "Web Form Target" - same as the CRM IFRAME in your crm_settings.php
	- "Get Call Launch" - set to WEBFORM


Notes:

- The example code shown assumes a campaign with only outbound auto-dial and inbound call handling in a RATIO or ADAPT dial method.
- The example code assumes Campaign Pause Codes is not enabled
- For more tight integration with your CRM, take a look at the AGENT_EVENTS_PUSH.txt document for information on how to get agent events pushed to your system
