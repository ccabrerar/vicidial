campaigns-lead_order_randomize	List Order Randomize	<QXZ>This option allows you to randomize the order of the leads in the hopper load within the results defined by the criteria set above. For instance, the List Order will be preserved, but the results will be randomized within that sorting. Setting this option to Y will enable this feature. Default is N for disabled. NOTE, if you have a large number of leads this option may slow down the speed of the hopper loading script.</QXZ>
campaigns-lead_order_secondary	List Order Secondary	<QXZ>This option allows you to select the second sorting order of the leads in the hopper load after the List Order and within the results defined by the criteria set above. For instance, the List Order will be used for the first sort of the leads, but the results will be sorted a second time within that sorting across the same set of the first List Order. For example, if you have List Order set to DOWN COUNT and you only have leads that have been attempted 1 and 2 times, then if you have the List Order Secondary set to LEAD_ASCEND all of the attempt 1 leads will be sorted by the oldest leads first and will be put into the hopper that way. Default is LEAD_ASCEND. NOTE, if you have a large number of leads using one of the CALLTIME options may slow down the speed of the hopper loading script. If List Order Randomize is enabled, this option will be ignored.</QXZ>
campaigns-hopper_level	Minimum Hopper Level	<QXZ>This is the minimum number of leads the hopper loading script tries to keep in the hopper table for this campaign. If running VDhopper script every minute, make this slightly greater than the number of leads you go through in a minute.</QXZ>
campaigns-use_auto_hopper	Automatic Hopper Level	<QXZ>Setting this to Y will allow the system to automatically adjust the hopper based off the settings you have in your campaign.  The formula it uses to do this is:<BR>Number of Active Agents * Auto Dial Level * ( 60 seconds / Dial Timeout ) * Auto Hopper Multiplier<BR>Default is Y.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_hopper_multi	Automatic Hopper Multiplier	<QXZ>This is multiplier for the Auto Hopper. Setting this less than 1 will cause the Auto Hopper algorithm to load less leads than it normally would.  Setting this greater than 1 will cause the Auto Hopper algorithm to load more leads than it normally would.  Default is 1.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_trim_hopper	Auto Trim Hopper	<QXZ>Setting this to Y will allow the system to automatically remove excess leads from the hopper. Default is Y.</QXZ>
campaigns-hopper_vlc_dup_check	Hopper VLC Dup Check	<QXZ>Setting this to Y will result in every lead being inserted into the hopper being checked by vendor_lead_code to make sure there are no duplicate leads inserted with the same vendor_lead_code. This is most useful when Auto-Alt-Dialing with MULTI_LEAD. Default is N.</QXZ>
campaigns-manual_dial_hopper_check	Manual Dial Hopper Check	<QXZ>Setting this to Y will mean that any manually dialed campaign phone call through the agent screen will first check for a lead in the hopper with the same phone number, and if one exists it will be deleted before the manual dial call is placed. Default is N.</QXZ>
campaigns-lead_filter_id	Lead Filter	<QXZ>This is a method of filtering your leads using a fragment of a SQL query. Use this feature with caution, it is easy to stop dialing accidentally with the slightest alteration to the SQL statement. Default is NONE.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_active_list_new	Auto Active List New	<QXZ>This setting will automatically set an inactive list to active when it contains dialable NEW status leads and the campaign has less than this setting number of NEW status leads to be dialed. The order in which the next list is set to active is determined by the List Auto Active List Rank. This feature will only work if there has been calling on this campaign within the last hour. If no leads have been dialed within the last hour in this campaign, then this feature will not function. Default is DISABLED. This feature will only work if the Call Quota Lead Ranking feature is also enabled.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_quota_lead_ranking	Call Quota Lead Ranking	<QXZ>This setting will allow you to choose a Settings Container which has the settings you want to use for Call Quota Lead Ranking. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-demographic_quotas	Demographic Quotas	<QXZ>This setting will enable or disable the Demographic Quotas feature for this campaign. For these features to work, you will need to select a value Container in the setting below. This feature is not related to Call Quota Lead Ranking and the two features should not be active on any single campaign at the same time. For more information, read the DEMOGRAPHIC_QUOTAS.txt document. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-demographic_quotas_rerank	Demographic Quotas Force Re-Rank	<QXZ>By default, Demographic Quotas will only re-rank the leads in the campaign lists either when a quota has been reached or the campaign has run out of leads to dial. But this setting can force the system to re-rank the leads once using NOW, every hour using HOUR or every minute using the MINUTE setting. Keep in mind that depending on your system capacity and the number of leads in the campaign lists, this re-ranking process may lead to temporary system disruption, especially if it is run very frequently. When NOW is used, after the re-ranking process, the value of this setting will go back to NO. Default is NO.</QXZ>
campaigns-demographic_quotas_list_resets	Demographic Quotas List Resets	<QXZ>This optional setting can reset the active lists in this campaign if there are leads within the call time available and there are no more dialable leads in the campaign lists. We do not recommend activating this setting in most cases because it can result in customers being called an excessive number of times in a single day. Default is MANUAL.</QXZ>
campaigns-demographic_quotas_container	Demographic Quotas Container	<QXZ>This setting is where you select a DEMOGRAPHIC_QUOTAS container to be used for the Demographic Quota features to use for quota goals. For more information, read the DEMOGRAPHIC_QUOTAS.txt document. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_count_limit	Call Count Limit	<QXZ>This enforces a limit on the number of call attempts for the leads dialed in this campaign. A lead may go over this limit slightly if Lead Recycling or Auto-Alt-Dialing is enabled. Default is 0 for no limit.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_count_target	Call Count Target	<QXZ>This option is only used for reporting purposes and has no effect on leads dialed. Default is 3.</QXZ>
campaigns-daily_call_count_limit	Daily Call Count Limit	<QXZ>This feature, if enabled, will limit the number of times a lead can be called in a single day. Once a lead has reached this set limit, if the lead is selected to be dialed again, the called-since-last-reset flag on the lead will be changed to -Y- and the call will not be dialed. If you want to raise this daily limit during the day, you might need to reset your lists to be able to dial the leads that hit the previous limit earlier in the day. This feature may conflict with Auto-Alt-Dial features if they are enabled on a campaign. Default is 0 for disabled.</QXZ>
settings-daily_limit_manual	Daily Call Limit Manual	<QXZ>If the Daily Call Count Limit is enabled, this setting will determine if manual dial calls will be counted and or restricted in the daily call count limit. The DISABLED option will not count manual dial calls or restrict them as part of the daily call count limits, only auto-dial calls would be counted restricted. If one of the COUNT options is used, then manual dial calls would be included in the daily call counts. If one of the RESTRICT options is used, then manual dial calls would be restricted as part of the daily call count limit. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-daily_phone_number_call_limit	Daily Phone Number Call Limit System-wide	<QXZ>This feature, if enabled, will limit the number of times a specific phone number can be called in a single day through this campaign. Once a phone number has reached this set limit, if the lead is selected to be dialed again, the called-since-last-reset flag on the lead will be changed to -Y- and the call will not be dialed. If you want to raise this daily limit during the day, you might need to reset your lists to be able to dial the leads that hit the previous limit earlier in the day. This feature may conflict with Auto-Alt-Dial features if they are enabled on a campaign. Default is 0 for disabled.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_limit_24hour_method	24-Hour Called Count Limit Method	<QXZ>This feature will limit the number of calls that can be placed to a lead or phone number over a consecutive 24 hour time period. This setting will determine if the called count limit is based upon a lead or a phone number. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_limit_24hour	24-Hour Called Count Limit	<QXZ>If the 24-Hour Called Count Limit Method setting is not disabled, this setting determines the number of calls that can be placed within 24 hours. For example, if this option is set to -1- and a call is placed to a lead at 11:01, then the next time that lead could be called is after 11:01 the next day. There is no manual dial override for this feature, it will affect all normal customer calls placed within this campaign. If you use this feature with Lead Recycling enabled and the 24-Hour call limit is reached for a recycled lead, the recycling count for that lead will reset to 0 after the 24-Hour call count limit time expires. Default is 0.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_limit_24hour_scope	24-Hour Called Count Limit Scope	<QXZ>If the 24-Hour Called Count Limit feature is enabled, this setting will determine if the called count limit is counted using system-wide call counts or only the called counts within the lists for this campaign. Default is SYSTEM_WIDE.</QXZ>
campaigns-call_limit_24hour_override	24-Hour Called Count Limit Override	<QXZ>If the 24-Hour Called Count Limit feature is enabled, you can create a Settings Container of the CALL_LIMITS_OVERRIDE container type that will allow you to override the 24-Hour Called Count Limit for calls to specific states, based upon the area-code of the phone number being dialed. The area-code to state relationship is defined in the internal database which you can access by going to Admin, System Settings, Phone Codes. Default is DISABLED.<br>Example CALL_LIMITS_OVERRIDE Container Entry:<br>; The allowed methods are: state_areacode, state_areacode_postcode, state_areacode_postcode_state, state_areacode_state<br>method => state_areacode<br>; One line per state, with fields separated by commas: the country abbreviation, state abbreviation and the 24-hour call limit for that state<br>state => USA,FL,3<br>state => USA,GA,4<br><br>For more detailed information on how this works, read the CALL_COUNT_LIMITS.txt document.</QXZ>
campaigns-hopper_drop_run_trigger	Hopper Drop-Run Trigger	<QXZ>This setting, if activated, will ignore all hopper loading criteria for a single hopper run for this campaign and it will only load the DROP status leads from the active lists for the campaign into the hopper at the highest hopper priority, and once this single hopper run has happened, this setting will reset to N for this campaign and the hopper loading will go back to normal for the next minute when it runs. This process will also update any DROPs already in the hopper to the highest hopper priority if they are not already there. If the -All Drops- checkbox is checked, then any status with -DROP- in the status or status name will be selected, including all system statuses and campaign statuses whether they are for outbound or inbound calls. WARNING, when this runs it will not check to see if the lists have been reset, so you may be calling back DROP leads that were recently called. However, if the Drop Lockout Time has been enabled, that setting will be honored. Default is N, unselected, for inactive.</QXZ>
campaigns-drop_lockout_time	Drop Lockout Time	<QXZ>This is a number of hours that DROP abandon calls will be prevented from being dialed, to disable set to 0. This setting is very useful in countries like the UK where there are regulations preventing the attempted calling of customers within 72 hours of an Abandon, or DROP. Default is 0.</QXZ>
campaigns-force_reset_hopper	Force Reset of Hopper	<QXZ>This allows you to wipe out the hopper contents upon form submission. It should be filled again when the VDhopper script runs.</QXZ>
campaigns-hopper_hold_inserts	Hopper Hold Inserts	<QXZ>If enabled, this will insert leads into the hopper as a RHOLD status, so they can be activated by an outside process or utility. The AUTONEXT option is also an enabled option, but in the HCI Screen, the user will only have to click once for each call instead of twice. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-dial_method	Dial Method	<QXZ>This field is the way to define how dialing is to take place. If MANUAL then the auto_dial_level will be locked at 0 unless Dial Method is changed. If RATIO then the normal dialing a number of lines for Active agents. ADAPT_HARD_LIMIT will dial predictively up to the dropped percentage and then not allow aggressive dialing once the drop limit is reached until the percentage goes down again. ADAPT_TAPERED allows for running over the dropped percentage in the beginning of the shift -as defined by Latest Server Time set for campaign- and gets more strict as the shift goes on, for example, if there are 10 hours or more left in the shift, the TAPERED feature will not affect the adaptive dial level at all, as the number of hours left in the shift drops below 10 hours and gets closer to 0, the dial level will be dropped closer and closer to 1.0 as time goes on. ADAPT_AVERAGE tries to maintain an average or the dropped percentage not imposing hard limits as aggressively as the other two methods. You cannot change the Auto Dial Level if you are in any of the ADAPT dial methods. Only the Dialer can change the dial level when in predictive dialing mode. INBOUND_MAN allows the agent to place manual dial calls from a campaign list while being able to take inbound calls between manual dial calls.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_dial_level	Auto Dial Level	<QXZ>This is where you set how many lines the system should use per active agent. zero 0 means auto dialing is off and the agents will click to dial each number. Otherwise the system will keep dialing lines equal to active agents multiplied by the dial level to arrive at how many lines this campaign on each server should allow. The ADAPT OVERRIDE checkbox allows you to force a new dial level even though the dial method is in an ADAPT mode. This is useful if there is a dramatic shift in the quality of leads and you want to drastically change the dial_level manually.</QXZ>
campaigns-dial_level_threshold	Auto Dial Level Threshold	<QXZ>This setting only works with an ADAPT or RATIO Dial Method, and it must be set to something other than DISABLED and the number of agents setting must be above 0. This feature allows you to set a minimum number agents that predictive algorithm will work at. If the number of agents falls below the number that you have set, then the dial level will go to 1.0 until more agents log in or go into the selected state. LOGGED-IN_AGENTS will count all agents logged into the campaign, NON-PAUSED_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting or talking, and WAITING_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting for a call. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-available_only_ratio_tally	Available Only Tally	<QXZ>This field if set to Y will leave out INCALL and QUEUE status agents when calculating the number of calls to dial when not in MANUAL dial mode. Default is N.</QXZ>
campaigns-available_only_tally_threshold	Available Only Tally Threshold	<QXZ>This setting only works with an ADAPT or RATIO Dial Method, Available Only Tally must be set to N, this setting must be set to something other than DISABLED and the number of agents setting must be above 0. This feature allows you to set the number of agents below which Available Only Tally will be enabled. If the number of agents falls below the number that you have set, then the Available Only Tally setting will go to Y temporarily until more agents log in or go into the selected state. LOGGED-IN_AGENTS will count all agents logged into the campaign, NON-PAUSED_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting or talking, and WAITING_AGENTS will only count agents that are waiting for a call. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-incall_tally_threshold_seconds	Agent In-Call Tally Seconds Threshold	<QXZ>This feature allows you to specify the amount of time an agent is in a phone call past which the agent is not counted for dialing additional outbound calls while in an auto-dial mode. This feature only works when Available Only Tally is not active. Default is 0 for disabled.</QXZ>
campaigns-adaptive_dropped_percentage	Drop Percentage Limit	<QXZ>This field is where you set the limit of the percentage of dropped calls you would like while using an adaptive-predictive dial method, not MANUAL or RATIO.</QXZ>
campaigns-adaptive_maximum_level	Maximum Adapt Dial Level	<QXZ>This field is where you set the limit of the limit to the number of lines you would like dialed per agent while using an adaptive-predictive dial method, not MANUAL or RATIO. This number can be higher than the Auto Dial Level if your hardware will support it. Value must be a positive number greater than one and can have decimal places Default 3.0.</QXZ>
campaigns-adaptive_latest_server_time	Latest Server Time	<QXZ>This field is only used by the ADAPT_TAPERED dial method. You should enter in the hour and minute that you will stop calling on this campaign, 2100 would mean that you will stop dialing this campaign at 9PM server time. This allows the Tapered algorithm to decide how aggressively to dial by how long you have until you will be finished calling.</QXZ>
campaigns-adaptive_intensity	Adapt Intensity Modifier	<QXZ>This field is used to adjust the predictive intensity either higher or lower. The higher a positive number you select, the greater the dialer will increase the call pacing when it goes up and the slower the dialer will decrease the call pacing when it goes down. The lower the negative number you select here, the slower the dialer will increase the call pacing and the faster the dialer will lower the call pacing when it goes down. Default is 0. This field is not used by the MANUAL or RATIO dial methods.</QXZ>
campaigns-adaptive_dl_diff_target	Dial Level Difference Target	<QXZ>This field is used to define whether you want to target having a specific number of agents waiting for calls or calls waiting for agents. For example if you would always like to have on average one agent free to take calls immediately you would set this to -1, if you would like to target always having one call on hold waiting for an agent you would set this to 1. Default is 0. This field is not used by the MANUAL or INBOUND_MAN dial methods.</QXZ>
campaigns-dl_diff_target_method	Dial Level Difference Target Method	<QXZ>This option allows you to define whether the dial level difference target setting is applied only to the calculation of the dial level or also to the actual dialing on each dialing server. If you are running a small campaign with agents logged in on many servers you may want to use the ADAPT_CALC_ONLY option, because the CALLS_PLACED option may result in fewer calls being placed than desired. This option is only active if Dial Level Difference Target is set to something other than 0. Default is ADAPT_CALC_ONLY.</QXZ>
campaigns-concurrent_transfers	Concurrent Transfers	<QXZ>This setting is used to define the number of calls that can be sent to agents at the same time. It is recommended that this setting is left at AUTO. This field is not used by the MANUAL dial method.</QXZ>
campaigns-queue_priority	Queue Priority	<QXZ>This setting is used to define the order in which the calls from this outbound campaign should be answered in relation to the inbound calls if this campaign is in blended mode. We do not recommend setting inbound calls to a higher priority than the outbound campaign calls because people calling in expect to wait and people being called expect for someone to be there on the phone.</QXZ>
campaigns-shared_dial_rank	Shared Dial Rank	<QXZ>For campaigns that are set to a SHARED dial method, this setting will indicate the dialing priority among all of the SHARED dial method campaigns in the system for this specific campaign. The smaller the Shared Dial Rank number for a campaign, the sooner a call will be placed for that campaign. Default is 99.</QXZ>
campaigns-drop_rate_group	Multiple Campaign Drop Rate Group	<QXZ>This feature allows you to set a campaign as a member of a Campaign Drop Rate Group, or a group of campaigns whose Human Answered calls and Drop calls for all campaigns in the group will be combined into a shared drop percentage, or abandon rate. This allows you to to run multiple campaigns at once and more easily control your drop rate. This is particularly useful in the UK where regulations permit this drop rate calculation method with campaign grouping for the same company even if there are several campaigns that company is running during the same day. To enable this for a campaign, just select a group from the list. There are 10 groups defined in the system by default, you can contact your system administrator to add more. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-inbound_queue_no_dial	Inbound Queue No Dial	<QXZ>This feature if set to ENABLED allows you to prevent outbound auto-dialing of this campaign if there are any inbound calls waiting in queue that are part of the allowed inbound groups set in this campaign. Setting this to ALL_SERVERS will change the algorithm to calculate all inbound calls as active calls on this server even if they are on another server which will reduce the chance of placing unnecessary outbound calls if you have calls coming in on another server. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ> <QXZ>If the selected option includes CHAT, then no outbound auto-dialing will take place while an inbound customer chat is waiting.</QXZ>
campaigns-inbound_no_agents_no_dial_container	Inbound No-Agents No-Dial	<QXZ>If set to something other than ---DISABLED---, the selected INGROUP_LIST type of Settings Container will be used to determine if any agents are ready and waiting for phone calls from at least one of the listed In-Groups. The Container should have one line per In-Group. If there are less inbound agents available than the Threshold setting below, then no outbound calls will be placed for this campaign. Default is DISABLED.</QXZ>
campaigns-inbound_no_agents_no_dial_threshold	Inbound No-Agents No-Dial Threshold	<QXZ>If the Inbound No-Agents No-Dial option is enabled above, then this setting will be used to determine if the campaign will be allowed to place outbound auto-dial calls, if this number is greater than the number of inbound agents available. Default is 0, for disabled.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_alt_dial	Auto Alt-Number Dialing	<QXZ>This setting is used to automatically dial alternate number fields while dialing in the RATIO and ADAPT dial methods when there is no contact at the main phone number for a lead, the statuses to trigger alt dial can be set in the Auto Alt Dial page. This setting is not used by the MANUAL dial method. EXTENDED alternate numbers are numbers loaded into the system outside of the standard lead information screen. Using EXTENDED you can have hundreds of phone numbers for a single customer record. Using MULTI_LEAD allows you to use a separate lead for each number on a customer account that all share a common vendor_lead_code, and the type of phone number for each is defined with a label in the Owner field. This option will disable some options on the Modify Campaign screen and show a link to the Multi-Alt Settings page which allows you to set which phone number types, defined by the label of each lead, will be dialed and in what order. This will create a special lead filter and will alter the Rank field of all of the leads inside the lists set to this campaign in order to call them in the order you have specified.</QXZ>
campaigns-auto_alt_threshold	Auto Alt-Number Dialing Threshold	<QXZ>If Auto Alt-Number Dialing is enabled, and not set to MULTI_LEAD, then this setting will specify the number of call attempts to the lead after which the Auto Alt dialing will no longer place alternate number calls for a specific lead, if the lead is called after this number of attempts then only the main phone number will be called. There is also a List Override option for this feature. Default is 0 for the threshold being disabled.</QXZ>
campaigns-dial_timeout	Dial Timeout	<QXZ>If defined, calls that would normally hang up after the timeout defined in extensions.conf would instead timeout at this amount of seconds if it is less than the extensions.conf timeout. This allows for quickly changing dial timeouts from server to server and limiting the effects to a single campaign. If you are having a lot of Answering Machine or Voicemail calls you may want to try changing this value to between 21-26 and see if results improve.</QXZ>
campaigns-dial_timeout_lead_container	Dial Timeout Lead Container	<QXZ>This option allows you to select a Settings Container of the DIAL_TIMEOUTS type that will allow you to override the campaign dial timeouts on a per lead basis using a lead field value defined in the container. You can enable manual dialing and auto dialing overrides separately by defining which lead field is to be looked at for a dial timeout key value. If you wanted to use the -comments- lead field for manual dial timeouts, you would define manual_dial_field => comments. If you wanted to use the -comments- lead field for auto dial timeouts, you would define auto_dial_field => comments. after either or both of these are defined, you will need to define the key and value pairs for the dial timeouts. For example, if a key of -A- in the comments field should trigger a 50 second dial timeout override for the lead, you would define A => 50. You can define multiple key and value pairs in the settings container. Lead field names should be in lower case letters only. You must define the Lead Field Name above any Field Values that you define. Field value matching is case sensitive. We recommend not matching to field values that have spaces or special characters in them.</QXZ>
campaigns-campaign_vdad_exten	Routing Extension	<QXZ>This field allows for a custom outbound routing extension. This allows you to use different call handling methods depending upon how you want to route calls through your outbound campaign. Formerly called Campaign VDAD extension.</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8364 - same as 8368</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8365 - Will send the call only to an agent on the same server as the call is placed on, DISABLED, now same as 8367</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8366 - Used for press-1, broadcast and survey campaigns</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8367 - Will try to first send the call to an agent on the local server, then it will look on other servers</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8368 - DEFAULT - Will send the call to the next available agent no matter what server they are on</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8369 - Used for Answering Machine Detection after that, same behavior as 8368</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8373 - Used for Answering Machine Detection after that same behavior as 8366</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8374 - Used for press-1, broadcast and survey campaigns with Cepstral Text-to-speech</QXZ><BR>- <QXZ>8375 - Used for Answering Machine Detection then press-1, broadcast and survey campaigns with Cepstral Text-to-speech</QXZ>
campaigns-agent_search_method	Agent Search Method Override	<QXZ>This setting will allow you to override the dialplan agent search method and force one only for this campaign. LB will search for the next agent on any server to send the answered call to. LO will first search on the originating server then search for agents on other servers. SO will only search on the originating server for an agent to send the answered call to. Default is blank for disabled. WARNING, setting this to -SO- can result in a much higher number of dropped calls.</QXZ>
campaigns-am_message_exten	Answering Machine Message	<QXZ>This field is for entering the prompt to play when the agent gets an answering machine and clicks on the Answering Machine Message button in the transfer conference frame. You must set this to either an audio file in the audio store or a TTS prompt if TTS is enabled on your system. You can also use lead fields to generate audio filenames using the DYN flag, for instance using DYN--A--user--B-- for agent 1234 would look for a file named 1234.wav in your audio store to play. If you need more space to build your message with files, you can put them into a Settings Container and the use STC and then the container ID to use that settings container as your answering machine message. Another advanced option is LTT, if you have custom programming on your system to construct answering maching messages on a per-call basis. If you will be using the Agent API function vm_message, you will want to put LTTagent in this field. Another advanced option is to use a prefix of FHG along with a URL to pull an audio file from a webserver, preferrably a local webserver. This FHG option can be used with a Text-to-Speech service to play recording generated on a per-call basis, possibly from a custom agent script. Here is an example using this prefix, FHGhttp//127.0.0.1/agc/tts/--A--lead_id--B--_TTS.wav</QXZ>

This will also work through most VOIP -SIP or IAX trunks- providers that allow dynamic outbound callerID. The custom callerID only applies to calls placed for the campaign directly, any 3rd party calls or transfers will not send the custom callerID. NOTE: Sometimes putting UNKNOWN or PRIVATE in the field will yield the sending of your default callerID number by your carrier with the calls. You may want to test this and put 0000000000 in the callerid field instead if you do not want to send you CallerID.</QXZ><QXZ>If all of the CallerID options are enabled, this is the priority in which each type of CallerID will be used, 1 is top priority - <BR>1 - List CID Group Override <BR>2 - List CallerID Override <BR>3 - CID Group entry(CID Group Failover) <BR>4 - AC-CID AREACODE entry <BR>5 - Custom CallerID, Security Phrase <BR>6 - USER_CUSTOM CallerID <BR>7 - Campaign CID <BR></QXZ>

You can use single quote and amphersand characters as well so that you can create links and iframe elements. If you want to put urlencoded fields in this area, make sure you use the --U-- and --V-- flags for your variables instead of using A and B, for example --U--test_field--V--. You can also use the --M-- and --N-- flags to enclose basic Math equations to have them calculated when the script is loaded initially, for example multiplying test_field by 12 would be entered with --M--(--A--test_field--B-- * 12)--N--. For the SWITCH field type, you should define the list ID for the custom fields as well as the text that you want to appear in the button to activate the new form in a comma separated line, with one line for each button you want to appear. For the SWITCH field type, it is a requirement that one of the entries be the current list ID. For BUTTON, the only current option is to put SubmitRefresh as the Field Options, which will commit any changes you have made in the form and reload the form panel. For SOURCESELECT, if this field is set to use the -province- field to determine what values to use for example, then the first line in the Field Options box should be -source=>province-, without the dashes. As a note, you can only link a SOURCESELECT menu to a source field that is a TEXT, READONLY or SELECT field type. The next options line will be the first province value to look for, for example -value=>Ontario-, and if the value for that field for the lead matches, the next lines will be the options to show with the value and display text separated by a pipe. After that, you can add more values each with options after them, like the example below shows: <br>source=>province<br>value=>Ontario<br>option=>|select month here<br>option=>September|September<br>option=>October|October<br>value=>Nova Scotia<br>option=>|select month here<br>option=>June|June<br>option=>July|July<br>option=>August|August<br>value=>British Columbia<br>option=>|select month here<br>option=>January|January<br>option=>February|February<br>option=>March|March<br>value=><br>option=>|no match<br>This field is limited to 5000 characters in length, but you can double that by altering the database if you need to.</QXZ>

For RADIO and SELECT field types, the default must be one of the options defined for the field or NULL. For BUTTON fields, this is the text that appears on the button.</QXZ>
lists_fields-field_cost	Field Cost	<QXZ>This read only field tells you what the cost of this field is in the custom field table for this list. There is no hard limit for the number of custom fields you can have in a list, but the total of the cost of all fields for the list must be below 65000. This typically allows for hundreds of fields, but if you specify several TEXT fields that are hundreds or thousands of characters in length then you may hit this limit quickly.

Default is N.</QXZ>
lists_fields-name_position	Field Name Position	<QXZ>If set to LEFT, this field name will appear to the left of the field, if set to TOP the field name will take up the entire line and appear above the field. Default is LEFT.</QXZ>

Results in agents receiving about the same number of calls overall.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_call_finish: orders by the last time an agent finished a call. AKA agent waiting longest receives first call.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_inbound_call_start: orders by the last time an agent was sent an inbound call.

Since ring_all ignores agent wait time and ranking and will call every agent that is available for the queue, we do not recommend using this method for large queues. When using ring_all, agents logged with phones that have the On Hook Agent disabled will have to use the Calls In Queue panel and click on the TAKE CALL link to take calls in queue. The amount of time the agents phone will ring for ring_all is set to the On-Hook Ring Time setting or the shortest ring time of the phones that will be called. We do not recommend using ring_all on high call volume queues, or queues with many agents. The ring_all method is intended to be used with only a few agents and on low call volume in-groups.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>overall_user_level_wait_time: same as overall_user_level except will use longest waiting as secondary order.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>campaign_rank_wait_time: same as campaign_rank except will use longest waiting as secondary order.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>fewest_calls_wait_time: same as fewest_calls except will use longest waiting as secondary order.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>fewest_calls_campaign_wait_time: same as fewest_calls_campaign except will use longest waiting as secondary order.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>inbound_group_rank_wait_time: same as inbound_group_rank except will use longest waiting as secondary order.</QXZ>

The lead loader allows for field choosing and TXT- Plain Text, CSV- Comma Separated Values and XLS- Excel file formats. The lead loader does not do data validation, but it does allow you to check for duplicates in itself, within the campaign or within the entire system. Also, make sure that you have created the list that these leads are to be under so that you can use them. Here is a list of the fields in their proper order for the lead files: </QXZ><OL><LI><QXZ>Vendor Lead Code - shows up in the Vendor ID field of the GUI</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Source Code - internal use only for admins and DBAs</QXZ><LI><QXZ>List ID - the list number that these leads will show up under</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Phone Code - the prefix for the phone number - 1 for US, 44 for UK, 61 for AUS, etc</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Phone Number - must be at least 8 digits long</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Title - title of the customer - Mr. Ms. Mrs, etc...</QXZ><LI><QXZ>First Name</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Middle Initial</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Last Name</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Address Line 1</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Address Line 2</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Address Line 3</QXZ><LI><QXZ>City</QXZ><LI><QXZ>State - limited to 2 characters</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Province</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Postal Code</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Country</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Gender</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Date of Birth</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Alternate Phone Number</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Email Address</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Security Phrase</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Comments</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Rank</QXZ><LI><QXZ>Owner</QXZ></OL><BR><QXZ>NOTES: The Excel Lead loader functionality is enabled by a series of perl scripts and needs to have a properly configured /etc/astguiclient.conf file in place on the web server. Also, a couple perl modules must be loaded for it to work as well - OLE-Storage_Lite and Spreadsheet-ParseExcel. You can check for runtime errors in these by looking at your apache error_log file. Also, for duplication checks against campaign lists, the list that has new leads going into it does need to be created in the system before you start to load the leads.</QXZ>
international_dnc_loader	International DNC Loader	<QXZ>The international DNC loader is used to upload and store DNC lists by country in the dialer database, which can then be used to scrub against in the lead loader.  This feature requires that the "Enable International DNC" feature be turned on in the system settings.<BR><BR>A background script constantly runs and checks a user-defined location for files to load.  This places them in a queue table, the contents of which are displayed in this interface.  From here the user can see what files have been uploaded, are being processed, or are finished/cancelled.<BR><BR>Uploaded files can be processed by assigning them a country code, designating whether or not the uploaded file is meant to purge said country's current DNC list or append to it, and selecting the file format the DNC file follows.  <BR><BR>Files are processed automatically when the user presses the "START FILE" button and their progress can be tracked.  Or the file can be cancelled and removed from the queue.</QXZ>

international_dnc_loader-file_layout	DNC file layout	<QXZ>This field tells the file processing script what kind of file is being loaded and where to look in the file for the phone numbers.  The file formats displayed in the drop-down menu are gotten from the settings container "DNC_IMPORT_FORMATS", and formats should be defined or altered there.</QXZ>
international_dnc_loader-start_cancel	Start/cancel file	<QXZ>If the user has properly defined a country code, file action, and file layout for an uploaded "READY" file, they can click the "START FILE" button to set the file status to "PENDING", which will cause it to be picked up and processed by the automated processing script.

They do this by using the agent-answered percentage of answering machines and subtracting that percentage from the number of drops. Then that new drop number is divided by the total agent-answered human-answered calls PLUS the number of drops. This differs in several ways from the way it had been done, as well as the way the drop percentage has been calculated in the USA and Canada. This new UK drop calculation method can be activated as a system setting AND a campaign option. Both must be enabled for the campaign to use the new method.

For example, you can set the IP List for Agent web access to DISABLED to allow anyone in the User Group to log in as an agent from any location, this is the default behavior. You can then set an IP List with one IP Address in it so within that same User Group, managers will only be able to log in to the admin web screens from that one location. You can also set an IP List with no entries in it for the API access IP List to not allow any user in that User Group to use the APIs.</QXZ><BR><BR><QXZ>This IP whitelisting authentication is designed to happen after user authentication in order to allow a specific user to be set to ignore the IP List blocking feature, as well as to be able to have the IP List feature work on a per-User-Group basis.</QXZ><BR><BR><QXZ>There is also a System-wide Blacklist option that allows you to specify an IP List to use to block all web service access to all users coming from the IP Addresses listed in the system settings blacklist IP List.</QXZ><BR><BR><QXZ>In order to use any of these features, the System Settings option Allow IP Lists must be enabled on your system. Then you will see the IP Lists Admin section appear in the Admin menu.</QXZ>

It will use APOP if the server appears to support it and it can be used to successfully log on, then try similarly with CRAM-MD5, and finally PASS. APOP and CRAM-MD5 imply that an MD5 checksum will be used instead of sending your password in cleartext. However, if the server does not claim to support APOP or CRAM-MD5, the cleartext method will be used. Be careful. There are a few servers that will send a timestamp in the banner greeting, but APOP will not work with them, for instance if the server does not know your password in cleartext. If you think your authentication information is correct, you may have to use PASS for that server. The same applies to CRAM-MD5.</QXZ>

erlang_report	Erlang report	<QXZ>This report uses Erlang B and C formulas to generate call center stats based on call activity for selected campaigns and/or ingroups across a specified date range.  From these statistics and also by entering a desired drop call rate, this report can be used to calculate a recommend number of agents to have on the phones to reach the desired drop rate entered, and depending on whether the report type being run is -B- or -C-, it will display statistics pertaining to call loss (drop) probability, or wait time probability.</QXZ><BR><BR><B><QXZ>COST ANALYSIS STATS</QXZ></B><BR><QXZ>This is an entirely optional set of data that can be entered to calculate the monetary performance of campaigns/call centers.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>Actual agents</U> = If you know the actual number of agents and wish to use this in the report caluclations, enter a non-zero value here.

Unlike other reports, <u>this includes calls that start in the preceding hour, if the length of the call causes the call to end in the current hour</u>.  Example: an inbound call to the system begins at 9:59am and lasts for three minutes, ending at 10:02am.  This call will be counted in both intervals.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>TOTAL TIME</U> = The total amount of time calls were active within this call interval.  This includes time in queue waiting for an agent, and as stated for the CALLS section above, calls starting in one hour and ending in the other will have the time spent in each interval counted in both.  In the above example, 1 minute will be attributed to the 9am hour and 2 minutes to the 10am hour.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>AVERAGE TIME</U> = The average call length for the interval, taken by dividing the total time of call activity within this interval divided by the number of calls active within this interval.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>DROPPED HOURS</U> = The total amount of time taken by calls that were dropped with time active within this call interval.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>BLOCKING</U> = The drop rate, expressed as a decimal in TEXT or a percent in graph form, of an hourly interval.

Both this and the P<sub><small>queued</small></sub> formulas above are only valid if -M- is greater than -E-, that is, the number of trunks in a system is greater than the number of Erlangs.</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>REC AGENTS</U> = The recommended number of agents needed to meet either the desired drop rate or the desired queue probability.  These values are entered by the user and depending on whether the report being run is type -B- or type -C- the report will base their estimate on one of those values.

This is reached by using the Erlang B formula, for both the B and C report.  Since Vicidial does not log what calls were queued in outbound dialing, the -C- report instead uses the drop rate of outbound calls to estimate agents.  The formula is</QXZ><BR><BR> GoS = (E<sup>M</sup>/M!)<big>/</big>(<big>&#8721;</big><sup>M</sup><sub style='margin-left:-10px;'>n=0</sub> E<sup>n</sup>/n!)<BR><BR><QXZ>where -GoS- is the current drop rate, -E- is the Erlang value, and -M- is the number of lines/agents</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>CALLS/AGENT</U> = The average number of calls each agent received for the time interval, gotten by dividing the number of calls by the number of agents (estimated, if an -actual agent- value is not given)</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>REV/CALL</U> = Average revenue per call, taken by multiplying the revenue per sale by the number of sales, then dividing by the number of calls</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>REV/AGENT</U> = Average revenue generated per agent, based on the total revenue (sales * revenue per sale) divided by the number of agents (estimated, if an -actual agent- value is not given)</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>TOTAL REV</U> = Total revenue, gotten by multiplying the number of sales by the revenue per sale</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>TOTAL COST</U> = Total cost, gotten by multiplying the agent rate by the number of agents (estimated, if an -actual agent- value is not given)</QXZ><BR><QXZ><U>MARGIN</U> = The difference between the total revenue and the total cost</QXZ>

alt_multi_urls	Alternate Multi URLs	<QXZ>This page allows you to define Alternate URLs with conditions in place of the simple URL option for Dispo, Start, Add Lead or No Agent URLs. The RANK field will define the order in which the URLs are requested, this is important because if you have a URL that may take a few seconds to run ranked as 1, that will mean that any URLs ranked after it will have to wait to be run until that first URL request receives a response. The ACTIVE field will determine whether the specific URL is run. The STATUSES field only works for the Dispo URLs and will determine which disposition statuses will trigger the URL being run, if you want to run the entry for all statuses just fill in ---ALL--- in this field, if you want only a few statuses, separate them by spaces. If populated, the LISTS field will limit the calls that the URL is run from to only the list IDs listed in this field. To have it run for all lists, leave the field blank, if you want only a few lists, separate them by spaces. The MIN LENGTH field will limit the calls that the URL is run for to only calls that are this minimum length in seconds and higher, default is 0. The min length option does not work for No Agent Call URLs. The URL field works the same as it would in the URL option in campaigns, in-groups and lists, and it is also limited to 2000 characters in length. If you want to delete a URL, it must first be set to not active, then you can click on the DELETE link below the SUBMIT button for that URL entry.</QXZ>
amm_multi	AM Message Wildcards	<QXZ>This page allows you to define Am Message Wildcards that will check lead data from the defined lead fields for matches in the defined order specified on this page. For example, if you add a wildcard with the word -vacation- tied to the vendor_lead_code field, and the lead being played a message has -vacation- in that field, then it will hear the message defined in that AM Message Wildcard record. If you want to delete a wildcard, it must first be set to not active, then you can click on the DELETE link below the SUBMIT button for that wildcard entry</QXZ>
user_list_new_limits	User List New Lead Limits	<QXZ>If the system setting for New Leads Per List Limit is enabled, then this page allows for the setting of per-user per-list new lead limit overrides to those List limits.

custom_reports_admin-path_name	Path name	<QXZ>The path on the domain where the report is located.  When the domain is blank it is assumed that the report is housed on the local web server.</QXZ>
custom_reports_admin-constants	Preset constants	<QXZ>Here is where a user can define a preset value to pass to the report when it is accessed from the custom report link.  This is useful if the user is viewing a report that accepts multiple variables that change the report output and there is a certain set of report parameters the user frequently uses and they wish to save time by coming to the report with those values already set.</QXZ><BR><B><QXZ>Variable name</QXZ> -</B><QXZ>The enters the variable name here.  Names allow alphanumeric characters, underscores, and to a limited extent brackets.  Brackets are used to pass an array to the report and should be placed at the end of the variable name, such as 'var_name[]'.  The interface will condense brackets by removing any characters within a pair of them, and will also remove unmatched brackets.</QXZ><BR><B><QXZ>Value</QXZ> -</B><QXZ>Then, the user enters a variable value in the 'Value' field, either by selecting a pre-defined variable value or a custom value.  With the exception of 'datetime' and 'filedatetime', all pre-defined variables are dates in yyyy-mm-dd format.  The predefined values are: 'today' for today's date, 'yesterday' for yesterday's date, 'datetime' which is a timestamp in the format of 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:ii:ss', 'filedatetime' which is an all-numeric timestamp in the format 'yyyymmddhhiiss', and 6/7/8/13/14/15/30days, all of which are the date 6/7/etc days ago.  If the user would like to define their own value for the variable, they can set the value to 'Custom Value', then fill out the custom value in the field to the right.  Click 'ADD' to add the variable name/value pair to the presets to include in the report.  Values will be URL-encoded prior to being entered in the database.</QXZ>

The name/value pairs are displayed per-line and are fully editable.  Users can also remove variables simply by deleting the line they are displayed on, or can enter new name/value pairs per line.  Variables can also be separated by an ampersand as in the typical URL GET display - the dialer interface will make the necessary adjustments to display them properly in this textarea field.</QXZ>
inbound_groups-na_chat_url	No Agent Chat URL	<QXZ>This web URL address is not seen by the agent, but if it is populated it is called every time a chat that is not handled by an agent is hung up or transferred. Uses the same variables as the web form fields and scripts. --A--dispo--B-- can be used to retrieve the system-defined disposition for the chat. This URL can NOT be a relative path. Default is blank.</QXZ> <QXZ>Custom Fields are not available with this feature.</QXZ>
inbound_groups-next_agent_chat	Next Agent Chat	<QXZ>This determines which agent receives the next chat that is available:</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>random: orders by the random update value in the live_agents table</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_call_start: orders by the last time an agent was sent a call/chat. Results in agents receiving about the same number of calls/chats overall.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_call_finish: orders by the last time an agent finished a call/chat. AKA agent waiting longest receives first call.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_inbound_call_start: orders by the last time an agent was sent an inbound call. Results in agents receiving about the same number of calls/chats overall.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_inbound_call_finish: orders by the last time an agent finished an inbound call. AKA agent waiting longest receives first call.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_inbound_filtered_call_start: orders by the last time an agent was sent an inbound call that was not of a filtered-out status, in-group or length.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>oldest_inbound_filtered_call_finish: orders by the last time an agent finished an inbound call that was not of a filtered-out status, in-group or length.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>overall_user_level: orders by the user_level of the agent as defined in the users table a higher user_level will receive more calls/chats.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>inbound_group_rank: orders by the rank given to the agent for the specific inbound group. Highest to Lowest.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>campaign_rank: orders by the rank given to the agent for the campaign. Highest to Lowest.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>ingroup_grade_random: gives a higher probability of getting a call/chat to the higher graded agents by in-group.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>campaign_grade_random: gives a higher probability of getting a call/chat to the higher graded agents by campaign.</QXZ><BR> &nbsp; - <QXZ>fewest_calls: orders by the number of calls/chats received by an agent for that specific inbound group.

Since ring_all ignores agent wait time and ranking and will call every agent that is available for the queue, we do not recommend using this method for large queues. When using ring_all, agents logged with phones that have the On Hook Agent disabled will have to use the Calls In Queue panel and click on the TAKE CALL link to take calls in queue. The amount of time the agents phone will ring for ring_all is set to the On-Hook Ring Time setting or the shortest ring time of the phones that will be called. We do not recommend using ring_all on high call volume queues, or queues with many agents. The ring_all method is intended to be used with only a few agents and on low call volume in-groups.</QXZ>

ACCIDADD	AC-CID Bulk Add	<QXZ>This allows you to paste in a listing of CIDs to insert into a campaign AC-CID list or CID Group list.

The area code lookup is designed to work only with numbers in the North American Numbering Plan as it uses the first three digits of each CID. The description will automatically be filled with the appropriate US state abbreviation corresponding to the given CIDs 3-digit area code. <li><b>CSV</b> - This will take a comma separated list in the format of  NPA,CID,DESCRIPTION,ACTIVE and insert each line into the specified campaigns AC-CID list using the supplied values. For example, given a listing of  813,7271234567,Florida,Y  will result in an AC-CID entry for area code 813 using the CID 7271234567 and a description of -Florida- with the status being active. Descriptions are limited to 50 characters. For CID Groups of a STATE type, use this format for CSV-  STATE,CID,DESCRIPTION,ACTIVE. The -ACTIVE- column will only be used if the Active select list above is set to -Input-.<li><b>STATE FILL</b> - Similar to the STATE LOOKUP method above, this will take a list of CIDs and insert them as AC-CIDs in the specified campaign but will also make an entry for each area code in a state based off the state the CID is in. For example, if given the CID 7271234567, 19 CID entries will be created with the same CID, one each for every area code in Florida. If you are inserting into a CID Group that is a STATE type, then you will not want to use the STATE FILL method.</ul> CIDs must be between 6 and 20 digits in length and only digits 0-9 are allowed. Optionally, you can have the AC-CIDs set to active upon insertion.</QXZ>
ACCIDDELETE	AC-CID Bulk Delete	<QXZ>This will delete the Areacode Caller ID entries you select from the next screen based on the campaign or CID group you select here. Setting Clear All CIDs to YES will bypass the AC-CID selection and wipe all AC-CIDs for the selected campaign or CID group.</QXZ>

rt_state_report	Real-Time State report	<QXZ>This report compiles statistical information by state or province and displays it graphically on a map of the US, with a subsection for Canadian provinces as well.  States and provinces get shaded a color representative of their performance for the type of report selected, meaning the better a state performs the darker it will be shaded on the map.  States with no report results will remain in a shade of gray.  A comprehensive report is always provided for the entire database, but statistics for individual states and provinces can be brought up simply by clicking on the state on the map (or in the case of small states and Canadian provinces, clicking on the box containing their respective abbreviation).  The report is automatically reloaded after a selected interval to reflect the current performance within the selected time frame.  It can display a simple inventory breakdown, call volume, contact volume, sales volume, contact rate relative to call volume, and sales rate relative to contact volume.  Data can be filtered by campaign, user group, user, in-groups, DIDs, and status types.  Additionally, the report can compile data based on either a starting point in time, or a window of time in hours relative to the current time.  The report handles both inbound and outbound calls.</QXZ>
